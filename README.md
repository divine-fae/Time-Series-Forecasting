# Time-Series-Forecasting
Both files contain a detailed analysis of the deployment of different time series models, mostly ARIMA models. The first project was undertaken with the primary motive of developing an adequate model for forecasting future malariatrends. It was found that ARIMA (1,0,0) fits the data best after comparison using the AIC and BIC criteria.
The trend analysis indicated that malaria cases in Awka South are growing at a constant quadratic rate. The forecasted malaria prevalence from 2024 to 2027 indicates that cases will fluctuate within a range consistent with previous years, with the number of cases generally staying between 10 and 30.
